# Docker Django Deployment with Nginx 🐳✨  

This repository provides a setup for deploying a **Django** application using **Docker Compose** and **Nginx**. It simplifies the process of containerizing Django apps and serving them securely with Nginx.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Dockerized Django**: Run your Django application inside a Docker container.  
- **Nginx Integration**: Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for better performance and security.  
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Pre-configured for database integration with PostgreSQL.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-django-nginx.git  
cd docker-django-nginx  

2. Configure environment variables:  
Update the `.env` file with your settings (e.g., database credentials, Django secret key).  

3. Build and start the containers:  
docker-compose up --build  

4. Access the application in your browser:  
http://localhost

## File Structure 📂  

- `django/`: Django application source code.  
- `nginx/`: Nginx configuration files.  
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for Django, PostgreSQL, and Nginx.  
- `.env`: Environment variables for the deployment.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.  

---

## Customization 🔧  

1. **Django Settings**: Update `django/settings.py` for your project requirements.  
2. **Nginx Configuration**: Modify `nginx/nginx.conf` to customize proxy rules and security settings.  
3. **Static Files**: Ensure static files are collected using:  
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic

## Deployment Notes 🚀  

- For production use, update the Nginx configuration to handle SSL (e.g., using Let’s Encrypt).  
- Configure a secure database password and other sensitive settings in `.env`.
